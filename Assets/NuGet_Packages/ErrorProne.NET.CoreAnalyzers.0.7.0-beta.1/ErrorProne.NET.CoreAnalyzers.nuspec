      0.6.0
        * Update all the dependendencies.
      0.5.0
        * Remove runtime dependencies for the prjoect (no RuntimeContracts, and no ErrorProne.Net.Core)
          to simplify deployment and to allow the customers to reference different versions of 'ErrorProne.Net.CoreAnalyzers'
          and 'ErrorProne.Net.StructAnalyzers' that was not possible before due to a common dependencies to 'ErrorProne.Net.Core.dll'.

          * EPC11: warns when Equals method is potentially implemented incorrectly.
          * EPC12: warns when generic exception instance is not fully observed (only `Message` was accessed in catch block).
          * EPC13: warns when possible-like result is not observed.
          * EPC14: warns when `ConfigureAwait(false)` is used even though a project is configured not to use it.
          * EPC15: warns when `ConfigureAwait(false)` is not used on an awaited task but a project is configured to always use it.
          * EPC16: null-conditional operator is used in await expression causing NRE if a task is null.</releaseNotes>
